# Sergey Rytsev 👋

*DevOps Engineer | Automation Enthusiast | Creative Problem Solver 🚀*

I'm a passionate DevOps engineer who loves automating everything and tackling tough challenges. I started my career as a system administrator and have grown into a DevOps professional. I thrive on building secure, scalable infrastructure, and I believe in *openness, kindness*, and a love for the craft. I always approach problems with curiosity and a smile 😊, because a friendly attitude and creative thinking often lead to the best solutions.

In my world, transparent communication and teamwork are key. I enjoy sharing knowledge and helping others – after all, we're all learning together! My values of openness and collaboration guide me every day, whether I'm writing a new script or architecting a cloud environment. And yes, there's always time for a coffee break ☕ while I experiment with the next pipeline or system improvement. For now, feel free to scroll down to see the DevOps magic unfold! ✨
